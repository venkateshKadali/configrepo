# configrepo
This is a configuration repository microservice which consists of all the microservices configurations in the form of yaml files.
Spring cloud config server always listens to this microservice and if there is any change in this microservice, it will get those changes.
This microservice doesn't need any build and deploy operations like all other microservices which reduces lot of time and easy to maintain.
